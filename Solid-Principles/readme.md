## SOLID Principles

- Single Responsibilty 

    - A Class should only have one reason to change.
    
    - Seperation of concerns (SOC) - Different Classes handling different,
    independent tasks/problems
    
- Open Closed

    - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    
- Liskov Substition Means :

    - You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.
    
- Interface Segregation

    - Don't put too much into an interface.
    
    - Split into seperate interfaces
    
    - You Ain't Going to Need It (YAGNI)
    
- Dependency Inversion

    - High-level modules should not depend upon low-level mones
    
    - Use Abstractions
